# Legal_Chatbot
This project aims to build a Legal AI Assistant that allows users to interact with a chatbot and receive precise, legally grounded answers. The assistant will draw from laws, constitutions, regulations, and legal documents, starting from static retrieval to more advanced understanding and generation.

The assistant evolves from simple keyword-based retrieval to context-aware generative reasoning over legal text.

In the final stages, it will support document uploads, question answering, and even flagging constitutional violations or contractual inconsistencies.

## Target Users
- Citizens wanting to understand their rights (e.g., in public spaces, work, housing).
- Activists or journalists needing quick reference to constitutional rights.
- Startups or SMEs checking compliance of agreements or internal policies.
